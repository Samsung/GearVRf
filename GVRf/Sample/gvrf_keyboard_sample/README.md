GVRf keyboards
==============
INTERNATIONAL, CASE SENSITIVE, MULTIPURPOSE


Engage the virtual keys
-----------------------

Samsung GVR Keyboards help GVRf developers to extract relevant data from their user bases. With default, extended, speech, and spinner modes, users will handle simple writing tasks with powerful, yet simple interactions.


### Default Keyboard
From a to z, and A to Z, users will be able to write just about anything they want.

### Extended Keyboard
Punctuation, and special characters available to take text expressions to the limit.

### Speech Keyboard
Cloud integration and exception handling to allow effortless text inputs.

### Spinner Keyboard
Designed to suit tricky layouts, and allow quick non-linear text editing and corrections.


Extra tips and sample codes
---------------------------

### STRUCTURED
* Rendering order management to work around complex UI transparency patterns
* Utility methods to solve complex 3D calculations, rotations and lookat algorithms
* Basic approach to work text formatting and style inside virtual reality
* XML approach to extensive data consumption and presentation
* Android native api integration to control hardware gestures and sounds

### ADVANCED
* Light and static HDRI mapping to improve immersion and realism
* Extensive use of shaders to provide texture caching for many scene elements
* Custom UV map shaders and animations to streamline application performance

### INTERACTIVE
* Dynamic asset compositions to deliver layered 2D-like UI animations (exception, mic)
* Asset pool management to support dynamic UI elements generation
* Useful dynamic assets including floating objects, animated sound waves and more

### COMFORTABLE
* Gaze/point events with snapping enhancements for usability
* Nesting objects approach to drive complex animation patterns
* Seamless positioning of UI elements to ensure comfortable UX


And it’s open-source!
---------------------

Suit yourself, really.

Take the code, improve it, give purpose, put your name over and show the world.
We are happy to help creating the best VR moment for humanity. :)
